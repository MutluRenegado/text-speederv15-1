🧭 TextSpeeder — Full Clean App Creation Flow

Version: 15.1.x
Scope: From zero → local app → integrations → production
Philosophy: Stable UI first, services later

PHASE 0 — FOUNDATIONS (ONE-TIME SETUP)
Goal

Create a stable, predictable frontend foundation that never needs to be rewritten.

Actions

Initialize project with Vite + React

Install dependencies

Confirm Node / npm versions

Lock basic scripts:

npm run dev

npm run build

Do not add Firebase, Stripe, or routing yet

Output

App runs locally

Clean terminal

No external dependencies

PHASE 1 — GLOBAL APP SHELL
Goal

Define how the app behaves before any screen exists.

Actions

Create index.html as a minimal app shell

Create src/index.css for:

global reset

background

layer z-index rules

accessibility priority

Create main.jsx to mount React

Create App.jsx as the single orchestration point

Key Rule

Nothing in the app should “accidentally” affect layout.

Output

Black background

Empty app renders correctly

No layout assumptions

PHASE 2 — LAYER ARCHITECTURE (GLOBAL)
Goal

Prevent UI chaos by enforcing explicit layering.

Layers (Always Present)

Background

Overlay

Texture

Content Host

Global UI

Accessibility

Actions

Create folders for each layer

Each layer renders a single predictable container

Z-index is fixed and documented

Accessibility layer always on top

Output

App has structure even before content

Future features cannot break accessibility

PHASE 3 — SLIDE SYSTEM (CORE UI MODEL)
Goal

Lock the rectangular slide concept that defines TextSpeeder.

Core Rules

Slides are rectangular, not fullscreen

Width is the base reference

Aspect ratio defines height

Empty space around slide is intentional

App background remains visible

Actions

Define a reusable slide frame

Center slide in viewport

Use aspect-ratio

Prevent stretching

Output

Stable visual identity

All screens feel consistent

Layout is future-proof

PHASE 4 — INTRO SCREEN
Goal

Create the first user experience without side effects.

Behavior

First screen shown

Video displayed inside slide

Video:

object-fit: contain

no scaling surprises

Buttons inside slide, near bottom:

Start

Skip Intro

Logic

Both buttons move to Welcome screen

No routing

No persistence yet

Output

Smooth intro

No layout jumps

Clear transition

PHASE 5 — WELCOME SCREEN
Goal

Give users clear intent choices.

Actions (inside slide)

Start the App

Test the App

Go to Docs (external)

Login (placeholder)

Rules

Same slide frame as Intro

No auth logic yet

No backend calls

Output

User understands what to do next

App feels intentional

PHASE 6 — CONTENT HOST & LOCAL NAVIGATION
Goal

Control app flow without URLs or routing.

Logic

Use React state:

view = intro | welcome | app | test


Content Host renders the correct screen

No react-router

Output

Predictable navigation

Zero routing complexity

Easy to debug

PHASE 7 — LOCAL APP FUNCTIONALITY (CORE)
Goal

Implement TextSpeeder’s actual reading logic locally.

Actions

Input text

Process text into reading units

Display reading session inside slide

Allow test/demo mode

No saving yet

Output

App is usable without internet

Core value is proven

PHASE 8 — ACCESSIBILITY & GLOBAL UI
Goal

Ensure the app is usable by everyone.

Actions

Add accessibility toggle

Ensure it is never blocked

Add global UI controls (theme, etc.)

Rules

Accessibility layer always wins

No overlay can block it

Output

Compliance-ready UI

Ethical and future-proof

PHASE 9 — FIREBASE INTEGRATION (AFTER UI IS STABLE)
Goal

Add backend without breaking UI.

Order

Firebase config only

Firebase Auth

Firestore usage tracking

Tier logic (Free / Standard / Premium)

Rules

UI does not call Firebase directly

Use services + context

Feature-gate, don’t rewrite

Output

App remains stable

Backend is modular

PHASE 10 — STRIPE INTEGRATION
Goal

Enable monetization cleanly.

Actions

Define plans

Create checkout service

Connect tiers to usage

No UI rewrite

Output

Monetization without UI debt

PHASE 11 — PRODUCTION HARDENING
Goal

Prepare for real users.

Actions

Error handling

Loading states

Empty states

Version stamping

Build optimization

Output

Professional-grade app

PHASE 12 — DEPLOYMENT & CI/CD
Goal

Ship safely.

Actions

GitHub repo

Firebase Hosting

Optional auto-deploy

Version tags

Output

Repeatable releases

Confidence in changes

FINAL PRINCIPLE (MOST IMPORTANT)

UI stability comes before services.
Services plug in — they do not dictate layout.

You followed this correctly.
